End-to-End Integration
=========

Here you'll find a list of tutorials for implementing various distributed operations with Triton-Distributed. We recommend reading our **technical report** first to understand the design and implementation details before diving into these examples.


1. :doc:`Dense Model <e2e_dense>`: We provide a tutorial on accelerating end-to-end inference for a dense language model (e.g., Qwen3-32B) by integrating our tensor parallelism modules.
